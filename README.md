## Introduction
Almost all modern computing centers around a basic client-server model. Basically a customer makes a request, and with permissions, the server responds to that request.

### Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. On-demand delivery indicates that AWS has the resources you need, when you need them. You don't need to tell us in advance that you're going to need them. Suddenly you find yourself needing 300 virtual servers. Well, just a few clicks and launch them. Or you need 2000 terabytes of storage. You don't have to tell us in advance, just start using the storage you need, when you need it. Don't need them anymore, just as quickly, you can return them and stop paying immediately. That kind of flexibility is just not possible when you're managing your own data centers.

**` Benefits of cloud computing `**
- Trade upfront expense for variable expense
Upfront expense refers to data centers, physical servers, and other resources that you would need to invest in before using them. Variable expense means you only pay for computing resources you consume instead of investing heavily in data centers and servers before you know how youâ€™re going to use them.
- Stop spending money to run and maintain data centers
Computing in data centers often requires you to spend more money and time managing infrastructure and servers. A benefit of cloud computing is the ability to focus less on these tasks and more on your applications and customers.



Data and Application lives and runs in a Region, one of the first decision you get to make is which region to pick? 

**`Four Business factors`** influence the selection of a region
- Compliance  --> Data must live inside some boundary/not
- Proximity  --> How close you are to your customer base (Latency will be less)
